summary: A short animation I worked on with Olivia Murray for my ICS 111 Final Project.

<img class="ui square floated image" src="../images/spaceship2.png">

This short animation follows a group of kids as they travel through space to find an inhabitable planet to escape their dying world. 
This project was developed with the use of [EZ Graphics](http://www2.hawaii.edu/~dylank/ics111/) which was developed by a former student. It
made the animation a lot easier for beginning computer science students to work with Java. This project allowed us to make use of
object oriented programming and scripting. As for the code itself, Olivia did most of the scripting and finding of images while I worked
on the back bone of it.

The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/jpham79/shortAnimation).
