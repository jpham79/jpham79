summary: I developed a simple palindrome checker for my ICS 211 class.

Palindrome Checker is a simple java application that takes in a string and uses stack operations in order to verify if the given string is a palindrome. This project allowed me to get myself more familiar with the stack data structure and was good practice for future projects using the stack data structure.
