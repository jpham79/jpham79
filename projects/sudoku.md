I was given a skeleton by Professor Cam Moore of my ICS 211 class and received some aid from Olivia Murray in order to create this recursive Sudoku Solver that uses the stack data structure. This project allowed me to practice my recursion skills and further improve my knowledge of the stack data structure.
