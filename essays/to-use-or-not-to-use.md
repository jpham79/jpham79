##It Doesn't Matter
How your code looks... at least to the computer. You can write your whole program on one disgusting line if that's what you want. I don't care. You probably don't care either if that's what you're doing in the first place. However, if you do want others to care about what you're writing then perhaps looking into "Coding Standards" is a good place to begin. If you're a beginner programmer or just starting to learn the basics of computer science then you may not yet have been exposed to what has come to be known as "Coding Standards." What is it? Simply put, it's a set of "self" imposed(or by your boss/client) rules in order to keep your code readable and standardized across different versions.
