## To be a Hero or Stay Zero

When students first start learning how to program, they aren't taught low level languages like assembly.
They're taught higher level languages such as Java and Python. This is done so that the students are able to quickly
begin producing functioning code. This same idea or thought process of improving and creating best practices applies 
to many different things in software engineering and computer science in general. This is how the concept of *design patterns* came to be. 
Design patterns are the culmination of improvements and best practices over time when producing code. For a beginner, there is no 
reason to "re-invent the wheel." Rather, time would be better spent writing code and understanding the rationality behind certain design
choices. Design patterns allow beginners starting from zero to become hero in their field by providing a framework to build upon.
Eventually with enough experience, it'd make sense to start developing and experimenting with their own design patterns.


## Experience Using Design Patterns

I use design patterns everyday when writing code. It makes things easier and more accessible to others. When I first started developing 
web applications with other people for my job, we were using angularjs. AngularJs uses the MVW (Model View Whatever)design 
pattern which made working with others accessible and deliberate. In this case, we were able to split resources to work on
the model, view, or controller. By doing this everyone would understand what kind of code was being added, how it worked, and would
be able to produce their own code without worrying too much about what others have done before them. Without design patterns it'd be much
more difficult to accomplish tasks or modify existing code, so I challenge you to start using them if you haven't already.
