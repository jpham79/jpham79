## We've All Been There
It's late. You've been up all night working on your project that's due in two days, but you have no idea how to fix this bug that's been haunting you for the past 5 hours now. Your colleagues have no idea what's wrong with your code, you can't see any errors with your code, and you've completely lost hope. What do you do now? Quit? Give up? You can't let it end this way, so you make your way back to StackOverFlow and.. You've found someone with your exact same problem! Amazing! However, once you click on the link you're greeted with "Nvm fixed it lol."
